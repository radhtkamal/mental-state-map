# Mental State Weather Map

A minimal, non-judgmental tool for state-awareness and cognitive condition tracking.

**This is NOT a productivity tracker.** This is a weather map for your mind.

## What It Does

Instead of forcing yourself to maintain constant focus, this app helps you:

1. **Check where you are mentally** (2-3 times per day max)
2. **Match your work to your actual state** — not what you wish your state was
3. **Remove self-judgment** — states are conditions, not failures

## The Four States

- **🌤 Clear / Focused** — Deep thinking, writing, complex problem-solving, planning
- **🌊 Noisy but Functional** — Maintenance tasks, refactoring, reviewing, organizing
- **🌧 Overwhelmed** — Stop, regulate, move, breathe, switch environment
- **🌙 Low Energy** — Light admin, simple tasks, easy communication

## How to Use It Safely

✅ Check in 2-3 times per day maximum (enforced)  
✅ Match your current work to your current state  
✅ States are conditions, not failures  
✅ You're not trying to move to a "better" column  
✅ One marker only — just check where you are

❌ Don't over-design or add features  
❌ Don't treat it like a to-do list  
❌ Don't feel guilty about being in "bad" states

## Philosophy

- Work better when they understand their cognitive patterns

**You're not trying to fix yourself. You're trying to work with yourself.**
